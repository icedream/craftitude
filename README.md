Craftitude
==========

Craftitude aims to be a unified installation system for Minecraft mods and other
extensions. There will be a launcher and a client API which allows other programs
to use Craftitude repositories directly.

_For what may I need this?_

Let's say you are hosting a Minecraft server with mods and you want to invite people
to join your server, but they are either too lazy to get all the required stuff or
just don't have the experience to install mods properly (and you don't have time to
explain how to), then Craftitude is exactly what you want! Craftitude will have a
launcher allowing users to easily install mods with only one click. This launcher
can also be configured by you and redistributed so all the mods are already downloaded
directly without the need to be selected by the user.

_How is the progress until now?_

This project is a continuation of the [Modern Minas launcher project](http://github.com/icedream/modernminas-launcher).
I wrote this launcher especially for my mod-enhanced server to allow people to just join
the server by just logging in via this client. After the launcher became stabily usable,
I decided to enhance this system to allow other Minecraft servers to be made available
the same way.

Currently all the old code is being changed and ported to the new techniques Craftitude
will have and a draft for the repository is written all over the development. The code
for the client API is being actively written right now and the official repository itself
will be the next on the to-do list.
