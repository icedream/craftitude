So I became a developer of Craftitude. Now what?
================================================

1. The first thing you'll need to do is get a github account. Just register on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Generate an SSH key on your computer. Do that with puttygen on Windows or ssh-keygen from OpenSSL on Linux.
3. Add the public key to your SSH keys on your GitHub account. You can add them [here](https://github.com/settings/ssh) when you're logged in.
4. Install git or a GUI for it you can work with. Suggestions would be SmartGit, GitExtensions or TortoiseGit. And of course the git commandline itself.
5. Clone the repository to some good place on your HDD.
6. For ideal comfort, install a good environment where you can program in C#. I use VS 2012, MonoDevelop and SharpDevelop would work too with the client api code.
7. You need either Mono 3.x (compile it from [their repository](https://github.com/mono/mono) if needed) or .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile and Full installed.
8. Happy coding!
